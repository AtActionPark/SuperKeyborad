# SuperKeyborad

Easy to set up HTML custom keyboard. Mouse and key bindings, no dependencies, easy to plug into the web audio API, and lots of possible customisation.

#### Add the script to your project. 
```html
<script src="scripts/superKeyborad.min.js"></script>
```
#### Create a keyboard somewhere in your script
```javascript
let basicKeyborad = new Keyborad()
```
And voila, instant playable keyboard, hooked up to a simple synth.
